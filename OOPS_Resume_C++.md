# OOPS : 

## Q) What are the main features of OOPs?

- Inheritance
- Encapsulation
- Polymorphism
- Data Abstraction

## Q)  What is a class?

> A class is simply a representation of a type of object. It is the blueprint/plan/template that describes the details of an object.

## Q) What is Encapsulation?

> Encapsulation is an attribute of an object, and it contains all data which is hidden. That hidden data can be restricted to the members of that class.
Levels are Public, Protected, Private, Internal, and Protected Internal.

- This concept is also often used to hide the internal representation, or state, of an object from the outside. This is called information hiding. The general idea of this mechanism is simple. If you have an attribute that is not visible from the outside of an object, and bundle it with methods that provide read or write access to it, then you can hide specific information and control access to the internal state of the object.

- If you’re familiar with any object-oriented programming language, you probably know that these methods as getter and setter methods. As the names indicate, a getter method retrieves an attribute, and a setter method changes it. Depending on the methods that you implement, you can decide if an attribute can be read and changed, or if it’s read-only, or if it is not visible at all. (basically encapsulation saari cheeze ko ek saath rakhna hota hai, and controlling the access to those things ! )

## Q)What is Polymorphism?

> Polymorphism is nothing but assigning behavior or value in a subclass to something that was already declared in the main class. Simply, polymorphism takes more than one form.

- Polymorphism basically means for something to take more than one form . There are 2 types of polymorphism , one is COMPILE TIME POLYMORPHISM or OVERLOADING , what it means is that we can have the same fucntion but with different arguments and behaiviour , let's say I make a function that adds 2 no.s , now I can overload it to support 3 no.s or numbers of different data types !

- The second is RUN TIME POLYMORPHISM or OVERRIDING . A single base class can behave differently according to its objects . Like let's say I have a base class Cars , with a function ENGINE() , and class Tesla and class Ferrari inherits CAR. Now , Tesla and Ferrari can take to themselves to define how thier own ENGINE works , so even tho they both are CARS , their engine behaves differently . (Polymorphism bahut imp hai !)



## Q) What is Inheritance?

> Inheritance is a concept where one class shares the structure and behavior defined in another class. If Inheritance applied to one class is called Single Inheritance, and if it depends on multiple classes, then it is called multiple Inheritance. 

- There are different types of inheritence , multi-level , multiple , hierarchical , hybrid , etc . Inheritance is used to reduce redundancy in code (baar baar same hi cheez ko likhna avoid karna ) . 

## Q)What is an abstraction?

> Abstraction is a useful feature of OOPS, and it shows only the necessary details to the client of an object. Meaning, it shows only required details for an object, not the inner constructors, of an object. Example – When you want to switch on the television, it is not necessary to know the inner circuitry/mechanism needed to switch on the TV. Whatever is required to switch on TV will be shown by using an abstract class.

-  Making coffee with a coffee machine is a good example of abstraction. You need to know how to use your coffee machine to make coffee. You need to provide water and coffee beans, switch it on and select the kind of coffee you want to get.The thing you don’t need to know is how the coffee machine is working internally to brew a fresh cup of delicious coffee. You don’t need to know the ideal temperature of the water or the amount of ground coffee you need to use.Someone else worried about that and created a coffee machine that now acts as an abstraction and hides all these details. You just interact with a simple interface that doesn’t require any knowledge about the internal implementation. ( yeh example yaad rakhna and you'll never get confused about abstraction )


## Q) What is the difference between structure and a class?

> The default access type of a Structure is public, but class access type is private. A structure is used for grouping data, whereas a class can be used for grouping data and methods. Structures are exclusively used for data, and it doesn’t require strict validation, but classes are used to encapsulate and inherent data, which requires strict validation.

## Q)  What is a virtual function?

- A virtual function is a member function of a class, and its functionality can be overridden in its derived class. This function can be implemented by using a keyword called virtual, and it can be given during function declaration.

- A virtual function can be declared using a token(virtual) in C++. It can be achieved in C/Python Language by using function pointers or pointers to function.

## Q) What is dynamic or run time polymorphism?

> Dynamic or Run time polymorphism is also known as method overriding in which call to an overridden function is resolved during run time, not at the compile time. It means having two or more methods with the same name, same signature but with different implementation.
