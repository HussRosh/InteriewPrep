# Practice Questions 

> You need to solve every problem here , go to the link , write your code , it should not only pass the sample TCs , but also the submission ke baad sab chalna chahiye(all tcs should pass ) . Some of the questions , you might have already done on CB ya pehle , redo them np .

# Next Steps 

> You are going to read Narsimha's karumanchi's book for Arrays Searching, Sorting chapter . 

> And see all the videos from this playlist to clear binary Search  :
https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL_z_8CaSLPWeYfhtuKHj-9MpYb6XQJ_f2
(every video in the playlist is a problem on GFG , so after every video , solve the problem in code too )

> Only when you have completed everything above we will move to other Data Structures .
